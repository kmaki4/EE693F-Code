1- First, open the SimRIS_GUI.m and run it in MATLAB.

2- In the opened GUI, choose and select all parameters. Then, click the "Run SimRIS" button!
(Note: SimRIS needs a parallel computing toolbox!)

3- If the simulation is not executed, please check the Error Control Box!

4- If the simulation is executed, h, g, and h_SISO can be directly used from the MATLAB workspace.

5- Using the "Save as" button, the channels can be downloaded as a ".mat" format.
